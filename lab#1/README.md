* Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3).
* Write [your own PSG](https://github.com/TheRedGuy/Style-Guides/wiki/C-Style-Guide) (you can take existent one and modify it) and argue why it is better (for you) **(1 pt)**

Application Creation Steps
--------------------------
In the development process, I consulted the recommanded book (["Programming Windows, 5th Edition", by Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/)).
Also, I found myself consulting the documentation on the [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com) page.

I developed my program on Mac OS X using MinGW32 and Wine, as sugested by Mike Iachimovschi in his [blog post]().
