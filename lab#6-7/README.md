Windows Programming Laboratory Work #6-7
========================================

Title
-----
WinRT API

Mandatory Objectives
--------------------
- Your application ideea: Pomodoro App.

Additional Objectives
---------------------
- Intuitive design. **(2 pt)**
- Follow WinRT applications life cycle. **(2 pt)**

Development Process
-------------------
The development process of this application was very interesting, very similar to developing a web-app. 
Using HTML, CSS and JavaScrip for a desctop application seemed strange at first, but I got used to it quite easily. 
The idea of a Pomodoro app came from a laboratory work at IDEs course, but then I developed an iOS application.

Conclusions
-----------
Switching from Win32 API to WinRT API was unusual, but great, because using HTML and JavaScript reduces the volume of work needed to be done. 
However, for some heavy computations one should avoid using JavaScript, because it is slow. 
I enjoyed this laboratory work the most, and had a pleasure to work with WinRT.
